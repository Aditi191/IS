Malicious code or rogue programs or malware (short for MALicious softWARE) is the general name for programs or program parts planted by an agent with malicious intent to cause unanticipated or undesired effects. 

A Trojan Horse Virus is a type of malware that downloads onto a computer disguised as a legitimate program. The delivery method typically sees an attacker use social engineering to hide malicious code within legitimate software to try and gain users' system access with their software. A simple way to answer the question "what is Trojan" is it is a type of malware that typically gets hidden as an attachment in an email or a free-to-download file, then transfers onto the user’s device. Once downloaded, the malicious code will execute the task the attacker designed it for, such as gain backdoor access to corporate systems, spy on users’ online activity, or steal sensitive data. Indications of a Trojan being active on a device include unusual activity such as computer settings being changed unexpectedly.

A computer virus is a type of malicious software, or malware, that spreads between computers and causes damage to data and software. Computer viruses aim to disrupt systems, cause major operational issues, and result in data loss and leakage. A key thing to know about computer viruses is that they are designed to spread across programs and systems. Computer viruses typically attach to an executable host file, which results in their viral codes executing when a file is opened. The code then spreads from the document or software it is attached to via networks, drives, file-sharing programs, or infected email attachments.

A worm virus refers to a malicious program that replicates itself, automatically spreading through a network. In this definition of computer worms, the worm virus exploits vulnerabilities in your security software to steal sensitive information, install backdoors that can be used to access the system, corrupt files, and do other kinds of harm. Worms consume large volumes of memory, as well as bandwidth. This results in servers, individual systems, and networks getting overloaded and malfunctioning. A worm is different from a virus, however, because a worm can operate on its own while a virus needs a host computer.

Phishing attacks are fraudulent emails, text messages, phone calls or web sites designed to trick users into downloading malware, sharing sensitive information or personal data (e.g., Social Security and credit card numbers, bank account numbers, login credentials), or taking other actions that expose themselves or their organizations to cybercrime.Successful phishing attacks often lead to identity theft, credit card fraud, ransomware attacks, data breaches, and huge financial losses for individuals and corporations. Phishing is the most common type of social engineering, the practice of deceiving, pressuring or manipulating people into sending information or assets to the wrong people. Social engineering attacks rely on human error and pressure tactics for success. The attacker typically masquerades as a person or organization the victim trusts—e.g., a coworker, a boss, a company the victim or victim’s employer does business with—and creates a sense of urgency that drives the victim to act rashly. Hackers and fraudsters use these tactics because it’s easier and less expensive to trick people than it is to hack into a computer or network.

Ransomware is a form of malware. Cybercriminals use ransomware as a tool to steal data and essentially hold it hostage. They only release the data when they receive a ransom payment. Organizations most vulnerable to ransomware attacks hold sensitive data, such as personal information, financial data, and intellectual property.Regardless of the ransomware definition, once it enters your computer, it secretly infects it. The software then proceeds to attack files and access and alter credentials without the user being able to tell. As a result, the computer infrastructure is effectively held hostage by the person who controls the malware.


Adware is any software that displays online advertisements to users, with the developers of the software collecting revenue from those ads. Ads can be in the form of pop-ups, messages, new browser windows, new browser tabs, or additions and alterations to non-malicious websites. Any free, ad-supported software or service can be labeled as adware. However, adware is generally associated with software that generates ads the user did not specifically authorize, especially too many ads that overload a system and that affect or disrupt a user's normal online experience. Adware is often associated with malware, software used to gain access to a system to steal data and damage it in some way. Some adware may at first seem like an annoying but unavoidable consequence of downloading free software. However, the adware, besides serving ads, may also function as spyware, secretly collecting information about the user and reporting such data back to a cyber criminal.

Spyware is malicious software that enters a user’s computer, gathers data from the device and user, and sends it to third parties without their consent. A commonly accepted spyware definition is a strand of malware designed to access and damage a device without the user’s consent. Spyware collects personal and sensitive information that it sends to advertisers, data collection firms, or malicious actors for a profit. Attackers use it to track, steal, and sell user data, such as internet usage, credit card, and bank account details, or steal user credentials to spoof their identities.Spyware is one of the most commonly used cyberattack methods that can be difficult for users and businesses to identify and can do serious harm to networks. It also leaves businesses vulnerable to data breaches and data misuse, often affects device and network performance, and slows down user activity.


A rootkit is a software program, typically malicious, that provides privileged, root-level (i.e., administrative) access to a computer while concealing its presence on that machine. Simply put, it is a nasty type of malware that can severely impact your PC’s performance and also put your personal data at risk. Once installed, a rootkit typically boots at the same time as the computer’s operating system, or after the boot process begins. There are, however, rootkits that can boot up before the target operating system, making them very difficult to detect.


A ‘bot’ – short for robot – is a software program that performs automated, repetitive, pre-defined tasks. Bots typically imitate or replace human user behavior. Because they are automated, they operate much faster than human users. They carry out useful functions, such as customer service or indexing search engines, but they can also come in the form of malware – used to gain total control over a computer.Malware bots and internet bots can be programmed/hacked to break into user accounts, scan the internet for contact information, to send spam, or perform other harmful acts.
To carry out these attacks and disguise the source of the attack traffic, attackers may distribute bad bots in a botnet – i.e., a bot network. A botnet is a number of internet-connected devices, each running one or more bots, often without the device owners’ knowledge. Because each device has its own IP address, botnet traffic comes from numerous IP addresses, making it harder to identify and block the source of the malicious bot traffic. Botnets can often grow themselves by using devices to send out spam emails, which can infect more machines.

A logic bomb is a type of malware that contains malicious code that is discreetly installed into software, a computer network, or an operating system with the goal of causing harm to a network when certain conditions are met. It is triggered at a specific event and used to devastate a system by clearing hard drives, deleting files, or corrupting data. An event can be a specific date or time leading up to the launch of an infected software application or the deletion of a specific record from a system. In order to maximize damage before being noticed, logic bombs are mainly used with trojan horses, worms, and viruses. The primary objective of logic bombs is to reformat a hard drive, modify or corrupt data, and remove important files from the system. The devastation caused by a logic bomb can be a huge level. The intention of logic bomb attack is to cyber sabotage from a person within a company or organization who is authorized to access essential information, whereas other forms of malware, which break into a secure system. If employees believe they might be fired from the company, the logic bomb might be a way for them to take revenge on the company. Using the assistance of a logic bomb and diffusing it every day may be an ideal method for them, as they are the only ones capable of delaying. As a result, the attack can begin at any point over a predetermined time period or when they leave the organization.
